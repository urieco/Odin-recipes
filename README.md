The Odin Project's exercise with HTML

I will be doing Project: Recipes from The Odin Project  course. This project's goal is to make a basic website for three food recipes (spring rolls, turkey burrito and enchilada lasagna) with images, descriptions, ingredients and steps to make the food. <br>
Throughout this project, I will be able to demonstrate my understanding of Git Basics and HTML Basics.
