The Odin Project's exercise with HTML

In this project, I will be doing Project: Recipes from The Odin Project  course. The project's goal is to make a basic website for food recipes with images, descriptions, ingredients and steps to make the food. 
Throughout this project, I will be able to demonstrate my understanding of Git Basics and HTML Basics.
